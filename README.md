# Installation

I may post it to Chrome marketplace later, but for now you'd need to install it locally.

1. Get folder with the extension. You can do it in several ways: 
    - copy `dist` folder or ZIP file from the source code
    - direct ZIP file download: https://github.com/mg-wzl/bsky-custom-hidden-reposts/blob/main/download/bsky-custom-hidden-reposts.zip -> "Code" button, then Download ZIP
2. Unzip the archive somewhere safe (don't delete the folder afterwards or the extension won't work)
3. In Chrome: install the extension using Developer Mode (see official Google instructions [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked))
    - open "Extensions" ( `chrome://extensions/` )
    - enable Developer Mode
    - press "Load unpacked", chose the unpacked folder
    - disable Developer Mode
4. It's installed!
